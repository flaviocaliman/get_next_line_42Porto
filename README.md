# Get_Next_Line

Get Next Line is a project from School 42.

The project consists of creating a function that allows you to read an end-of-line
with a newline character ('\\n') from a file descriptor, without knowing its
size in advance. One of the aims of this project is to learn an interesting and highly
interesting new concept in C programming: static variables, and to gain a deeper understanding of
understanding of allocations, whether they happen in heap memory or in the
heap memory, the manipulation and life cycle of a buffer, the unexpected
complexity implicit in the use of one or more static variables.
